# Bias in Search Engines

This repository contains an analysis focused on uncovering potential biases in search engine autocomplete suggestions, specifically comparing Baidu and Google. The analysis is divided into two distinct tasks, each addressing different aspects of search engine behavior and sentiment portrayal.

## Task 1: Comparative Analysis of Autocomplete Metrics

In this task, the focus is on comparing Baidu Templates (Template 1 and Template 2) with Google across various categories. The analysis aims to uncover differences in how these search engines respond to user queries. The key metrics evaluated include:

- **Unresponse Rate**: The frequency at which the search engines do not provide any autocomplete suggestion for a given query.
- **Proportion of Suggestions Not Following Query**: This metric measures the extent to which the suggestions provided deviate from the initial user query.
- **Proportion of Suggestions Not Containing Group**: Analyzes how often the suggestions fail to include a specific group or keyword present in the query.

Each of these metrics is examined across different categories for Baidu Templates 1 and 2, as well as Google, enabling a direct comparison of their autocomplete behavior.

## Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Autocomplete Suggestions

The second part of the analysis takes a deeper dive into the sentiment aspect of autocomplete suggestions from Baidu and Google. This task involves:

- **Statistical Tests**: Applying methods like Fisher's Exact Test and Z-tests to compare the sentiment distributions between the two search engines. This analysis helps in understanding if there is a significant difference in the portrayal of sentiments in autocomplete suggestions.
- **Visualization**: Creating visual representations of sentiment distributions across various categories. This approach not only quantifies the sentiment biases but also makes them visually interpretable.

This comprehensive analysis aims to shed light on how sentiments are portrayed in autocomplete suggestions and whether there are noticeable differences in the approaches of Baidu and Google.
